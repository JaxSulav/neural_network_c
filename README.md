# nn_cpp
### Implementation of artificial neural network in C++ 

## The codes are designed to follow the concept of backpropagation, as described in my article [**here**](https://shresthasulav.com.np/neural%20network/2021/01/10/nn-step-by-step.html).

## Build Process: 

> Create a build directory

`mkdir build && cd build`

> Copy build.sh to build directory

`cp ../build.sh ./`

> Start build and make (executable wil be ./nn)

`./build.sh`

`make`
